## FBI vs Hacker

FBI : Federal Bureau of Investigation

#### FBI agent

- Seems professional : he wears a suit, he sate straight and used his hands to show he was attentive.
- The biggest threate are people with bad intetions
- He says you should choose the companies that keep your data carefully

#### Member of anonymous

- He doesn't sit straigh (he slouches), he wore his head in his head. He seems casual. A punk.
- The biggest threat for him are the FBI, the NSA and the CIA
- He says people need to have long passwords, and a different one for each web account.

I think the hacktivist is the most convincing, mainly because we can easily guess that the FBI agent's speech is biaised by his work for the governement. Unlike the hacktivist who speaks his mind, the FBI agent only says what would give the best impression to his company.

In the beginning there was only water. The creator was asking a little turtle to bring his brothers so they make up what would become California. He was then drawing rivers and mountains on the land, but they eventually got tired and were going all over the place, this triggered an earthquake and when they realized what they had done they changed their minds.

**Based story**

Ireland is a beautiful, green country. It is known for its rolling hills and dramatic coastline. But this picturesque landscape hides a dark past. For centuries, Ireland was ruled by foreign powers. It was invaded by the Vikings in the 9th century, and by the English in the 12th century. The Irish people were subjected to ruthless suppression and exploitation.

Since the 1990s, Ireland has enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity. The country has become a thriving democracy, with a strong economy. However, the legacy of its past is still evident. The Troubles in Northern Ireland, which began in the 1960s, are a reminder of the divisions that exist in the country. And the continuing influence of the Catholic Church is a legacy of the years of religious persecution.

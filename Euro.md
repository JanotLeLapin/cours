Women were supposed to stay at home to take care of the emotionalneeds of their husband and kids. It was considered as their main goal, their carrer. But there was a "Deep Dark Secret" that was never talked about : Many women had to work, mostly part-time, to manage to achieve a certain level of living that men could not achieve by themselves anymore. Still, men were embarassed and guilty and women said that they were only working for diversion wgeb children were at school.

At this time, everyone had to fit into boxes, which happened to be very tight. People felt the social pressure of gender norms.

One main thing happened by the end of the 50s, the "father figure" became the "daddy figure". Men were encouraged to take care of children, give bottles, change diapers, play with kids and finally teach them some very gendered skills, assuming that they knew them, many men had to learn them to teach them to their kids.

<p>In the 50s, it was not common for omen to work. Men were the
breadwinner of the household and was in charche and in control of the
financial status of their family couples didn’t share
responsabilities.</p>
<p>Women were supposed to stay at home to take care of the
emotionalneeds of their husband and kids. It was considered as their
main goal, their carrer. But there was a “Deep Dark Secret” that was
never talked about : Many women had to work, mostly part-time, to manage
to achieve a certain level of living that men could not achieve by
themselves anymore. Still, men were embarassed and guilty and women said
that they were only working for diversion wgeb children were at
school.</p>
<p>At this time, everyone had to fit into boxes, which happened to be
very tight. People felt the social pressure of gender norms.</p>
<p>One main thing happened by the end of the 50s, the “father figure”
became the “daddy figure”. Men were encouraged to take care of children,
give bottles, change diapers, play with kids and finally teach them some
very gendered skills, assuming that they knew them, many men had to
learn them to teach them to their kids.</p>
